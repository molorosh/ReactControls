# ReactControls

A collection of controls I'm writting for React.js

They are based around using standard HTML form controls where possible 
and avoiding pop-ups and extra layers.

Sometimes I like controls to not mess with the layout of the page of the  and those 
super-clever controls can be difficult to use if you have zoomed in the page as they 
effectively change the ]size and shape of that data item on the page.
